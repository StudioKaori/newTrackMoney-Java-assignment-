(Thatâ€™s the only way I knew, learnt from my classmate at that time.)

## JUnit test

JUnit 5.

mvn test
```
ExpenseItemTest and IncomeItemTest are included.

These inherite Item class. These two are kept in the "items" array and their static type is Item class. However, they behave differently in run-time. (i.e. having different item categories, returning the different amount of values.)

The tests were created to make sure their behavior in the run-time.
